What this can do right now:
- UDP, TCP, and HTTP connections
- Host server directly from game (peer to peer)
- WebGL build
- Transform syncing with one script (and a prefab)
- Automatic ID system for both synced objects and players
- Extremly robust and flexible event system

What this will be able to do in the future:
- Dedicated server (might even be written in c++ in the future)
- Websockets: while http is great, its neither fast or 2 way
- Variable syncing that will be used like playerPrefs
- Debugging

What this will be able to do far in the future:
- Voice chat (this might actually not be that far off)
- Encrypted messages for at least a lil security
